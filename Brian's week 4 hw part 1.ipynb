            "source": "If I were to open a Starbucks, where should I locate it? Clearly, the location is one of the most important business decisions for this venture. Is there a science to locating a StarBucks? Can we create a machine learning model to predict where a StarBucks is likely to be located? I'd like to find out.\n\nIf a reliable model can be made,it could be used in the process of opening a store. It could be used as a final sanity check, or at the beginning stage, to select a promising location. If a trustworthy model predicts with a high degree of confidence that a Starbucks should be located in an area, but there is not one there yet, perhaps that is an opportunity.\n\nAny person interested in opening a Starbucks should be interested in these results. This includes myself, other potential franchisees, and the Starbucks corporation itself, which operates many of it's own stores. The Starbucks competition might also be interested as they could possibly gain competitive insigths. I also believe others might be interested in this procedure, as it might be applied to predicting the location of other entities, based on the same sort of data.\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to prove the concept of predicting Starbuck's locations in general. I suspect it may work better or worse depending on the locations chosen for training and prediction, the radius size, and the specific features used in the model. I may vary those factors in order to prove the concept, which could then be applied carefully to a particular geographic area of interest at a later date.",
